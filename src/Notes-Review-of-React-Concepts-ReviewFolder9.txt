  1. Javascript Classes:
    - see https://app.pluralsight.com/ilx/video-courses/f4ccfaf2-29f8-416e-bb5d-34664ca1f136/c72fe2df-fa57-4b7e-b5a1-b19aee14c311/daf918cf-522f-4602-9b5d-0f132b46c5d4

    - cheat sheet on conditional rendering: 
        https://www.robinwieruch.de/conditional-rendering-react/
        
  2. REACT COMPONENTS - Javascript Component VS and React Component 

      - React component extends the JavaScript class called "Component".
        every react application is built in the foundation of React Components.

      - React component specifically App compOnent is just a Javascript function. 
          - defined in Pascal Case 
          - commonly called App component
          - App component has no parameter in its fucntion signature but you can pass props to it which 
            becomes its paramters.

          - App component has a "Return" statement. Which returns a code that resmebles HTML

          - a function component runs everytime it is displayed in the browser

          Example: 
              function App() {
                  const title = "Tochi"... variables are re-defined each time the function runs

                  .... busines logic code or implementation details

                  return (
                      <div>
                          <h1> Hello Chito </h1>
                      </div>

                  )
              }

  3. REACT JSX (a JSX is a combo of html and javascript code)
      - recall that I mentioned the returned output of the App component not only resembles HTML, 
      but it can also be mixed with JavaScript. In fact, this output is called JSX (JavaScript XML), 
      which powerfully combines HTML and JavaScript.

      - React Fast Refresh (changes are auto displayed in browser)
      - Hot Module Replacement (changes are auto displayed in the server)

      - JSX is a syntax extension to javascript.
      - currently there is no need to create a JSX file with .jsx extension. Compilers and 
        bundlers can be configures to recognize JSX code in a .js file.

      - Curly braces enables JSX to be embedded in an HTML 
          Anyway, JSX is one of my favorite things when being asked about React. Without any extra 
          templating syntax (except for the curly braces), we are able to use JavaScript in HTML. 
          Every JavaScript data structure, from primitive to complex, can be used within HTML with 
          the help of JSX.

      -  Question: Can JSX be directly rendered by browsers?
          Answer: No, browsers can't understand JSX. It needs to be transpiled to regular JavaScript using
          tools like Babel.

      - Question: How do you render a variable in JSX?
        Answer: Use curly braces {} to embed variables in JSX, like {myVariable}.

  4. Read about Javascript variables
      - https://www.robinwieruch.de/javascript-variable/

      - review C:\_AMyReactDev\chitojavascriptdev/Notes-Creating-Javascript-Dev-Project-and- React-Dev

      - Keywords Defining Variables:
          var - old way of defining a variable. Don't use it anymore 
                Variables declared by var are available 
                throughout the function in which they're declared.

          let - defines a variable. But you can change the value later.
                Variables declared by let are only available inside the 
                block where they're defined. 
          const - defines a variable. Can't change it later.


  4. LISTS IN REACT
      - array's built-in map() method is is the most common data manipulation method. 
        See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map

      - in React map() transform a list of items into JSX by returning JSX for 
        each item 

  5. EXAMPLE OF PASSING PROPS AND USING SPREAD OPERATOR
      Note: all function components by convention receive "props" even 
            if the function doesn't have the param "props coded

            Example:
                function Button() {
                return ( 
                    <button onClick={props.onClickFunction}>
                      + {props.increment}
                  </button>
                );
              }
      (1) See C:\_AMyReactDev\chitoreactdev\_guijt-house-react-projects\house-3-forsale-react-props
          
          houseArray passed as props called "list" <HouseList list={houseArray} /> 
          
          Referenced in HouseList = (props) => {
            <tbody>
              {props.list.map((item) => (
                <tr key={item.id}>
                  {Object.values(item).map((val) => (
                      <td>{val}</td>
                ))}
              </tr>
            )
            )}
            </tbody>
        }

      (2) Stories array passed to RenderTheList component as props called "list"
            <RenderTheList list={stories} />

            It is Referenced in RenderTheList component like this: 
              const RenderTheList = (props) => {
                <ul>
                  {props.list.map( (item) => {
                    return <li>{item.title}</li>;
                  })}
              </ul>

              }

        (3)  See C:\_AMyReactDev\chitoreactdev\_guijt-house-react-projects\house-3-forsale-react-props
              //Instantiate the HouseRow component and pass each record
              //to HouseRow component as props.
              //house={record} means access of the "record"  and 
              //assign it to variable "house"

              <HouseRow key={record.id} house={record} />

              It is Referenced in HouseRow component like this: 
                const HouseRow = (props) => (
                  <tr>
                  <td>{props.house.id}</td>
                  <td>{props.house.address}</td>
                  <td>{props.house.country}</td>
                  <td>{currencyFormatter.format(props.house.price)}</td>
                </tr>
              );

        (4)  See C:\_AMyReactDev\chitoreactdev\_guijt-house-react-projects\house-5-forsale-react-lifting-state-add-search-component
            
              React state and searchHandler passed to Search component
              <Search search={stateOfSearchComponent} onSearch={searchHandler}/> 

              It is referenced like this in Search component:
              
              const Search = (props) => {  
                <label htmlFor="search">Search:</label>
                    <input id="search" 
                      value={props.search}
                      type="text"
                      onChange={props.onSearch}/> 
                    <p> 
                      Searching for <strong>{props.search}</strong>
                    </p>
                }

      5. SPREAD OPERATOR
          See C:\_AMyReactDev\chitoreactdev\_guijt-house-react-projects\house-7-forsale-react-with-search-noadd-useEffect
          const addHouse = () => {
          //SetAddHouse is the state updater function 
          //JavaScript's spread operator allows us to literally spread all key/value pairs 
          //of an object to another object. This can also be done in React's JSX. 
          //To do that use spread operator '...' to pass all the object's key/value pairs as 
          //attribute/value pairs to a JSX element in this case 'item':
          //    <Item key={item.objectID} {...item}>  ) 
          setAddHouse([
              ...houseState, //this is the state. It gets updated
              {
                id: 4,
                address: "32 Valley Way, New York",
                country: "USA",
                price: 1000000,
              },
            ]); 
          }
            

  6.  Two ways of declaring a React component:
            //function Declaration
              function App() {...}
            //arror function expression
              function App() => {...}

  7.  EXAMPLE OF WRITING A COMPONENT USING "ARROW FUNCTION expression".

          const RenderList(props) => {
        
            return (
                <>
                  <ul>
                    {props.list.map( (item) => {
                      return <li>{item.title}</li>;
                    })}
                  </ul>
              </>
            )
          };

  8.  EXAMPLE OF WRITING A COMPONENT USING FUNCTION Declaration
            function RenderListUsingJSFunction(props) {
            return (
              <div>
                  <h2>Printed by JS Function</h2>
                  <ul>
                    {props.list.map (function (item){ //using JS function
                      return (
                        <li key={item.objectID}>
                        <span>
                          <a href={item.url}>{item.title}</a>
                        </span>
                        <span>{item.author}</span>
                        <span>{item.num_comments}</span>
                        <span>{item.points}</span>
                      </li>
                      );
                      })}
                  </ul>
              </div>

              );

  9. WHERE IS APP.JSX COMPONENT GET INSTANTIATED?
          
          Answer: In main.jsx (the entry point of a react application)
                  There are 2 libraries imported at the beginning of main.jsx
                    import React from 'react'; 
                    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
            Open main.jsx and index.html and read comments how React inserts
          itself ito HTML

          import React from 'react'; 
          import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'; 
          import App from './App.jsx';
          import './index.css';
          
          ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
            <React.StrictMode>
              <App />
            </React.StrictMode>
          );

  10. Handler Function of Events in JSK
          See: C:\_AMyReactDev\robinreactcoursedev\hacker3-stories-on-callback-handlers-3
          
            - link to React's Event Handler 
                https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-event-handler/

            - Three kinds of event handlers:
              see: Notes-hacker3
              1. inline event handlers 

              2. callback event handlers.
                  - see hacker3-stories-on-callback-handlers-3

              3  some event attributes of elements like button:
                  onClick event, onChange event, onSubmit event     

            - "synthetic event" - After opening your application in a web browser, open 
            the browser's developer tools "Console"-tab to see the logging occur 
            after you type into the input field. What you see is called a synthetic event
            as a JavaScript object and the input field's internal value.

            - to prevent native browser behavior of doing a browser refresh when a form 
              is submitted, react creates the so-called "synthetic event" as wrapper to
              browser native event to prevent refresh when a form is submitted. In react
              page refresh should be prevented.

            - Add listener listeners in JSX handler for user interaction. Example:
                    # if handleChange is a function which does not return a function
                      don't do this
                    <input onChange={handleChange()} />
                    
                    # do this instead
                    <input onChange={handleChange} />

            - Question: How do you attach an event handler in JSX?
                Answer: Use the appropriate attribute, like onClick={handleClick}.

            - Question: How do you pass arguments to an event handler in JSX?
                Answer: Use an arrow function to call the handler with arguments, 
                like onClick={() => handleClick(arg)}

            - Question: What is the purpose of the e.target property in an event handler?
                Answer: It refers to the DOM element that triggered the event, allowing you 
                to access its properties or manipulate it. 

            - Question: What does event.preventDefault() do in an event handler?
                Answer: It prevents the default behavior of the event, such as submitting a 
                form or following a link.   

            - Question: What is the purpose of the e.stopPropagation() method in an event handler?  
                  Answer: It stops the event from propagating up or down the DOM tree, 
                  preventing parent or child elements from handling the same event.
                  
            - Question: How do you access the event object in an event handler?
                Answer: Include (event) as a parameter in the handler function, like 
                function handleClick(event) {...}

                Example: see hacker3-stories-on-callback-handlers-3
                const handleChange = (event) =>{
                  console.log('The event is=' + event); 
                  console.log('The value of event is=' + event.target.value);
                  //assign the value to the updater method of the React.useState  
                  //which in turn will update value of searchTerm stateful value
                  setSearchTerm(event.target.value); 

                  //let's call the callback handler that was passed to the 
                  //props.onSearch property. Whenever a user types into the input field 
                  //now, the callback function that is passed down from the App component to the 
                  //Search component via Props runs. This way, we can notify the App component 
                  //when a user types into the input field in the Search component.
                  props.onSearch(event);
                }

  11. How to make all component talk to each other: 
            Answer: JSX CallBack Handlers. This is the only way child component communicate "up"
            see: c:\_AMyReactDev\robinreactcoursedev\hacker3-stories-on-callback-handlers-3\src hacker3-stories-on-callback-handlers-3

  12. More on Props, state, and ESLint 
          - Template Literal Syntax: console.log(`Hello ${firstName} ${lastName}`);

          - A point to consider regarding ESLint: you might encounter an error stating, "error 'list' 
            is missing in props validation." in cases where JavaScript is the 
            exclusive choice, (not prop-types) my suggestion is to disable this specific ESLint 
            rule in your configuration file to resolve the issue.
              rules: {
                  ...
                  'react/prop-types': 'off',
                },

          - see Notes-hacker3-txt 
          - props are used to pass variable information to child components only and 
            CANNOT be changed by receiving component

          - React State: 
                - Since Props cannot be changed (mutated), React introduces a data structure
                  that can be mutated. It is called "React State"
                - "React state" can be passed with props 

                - when react state is passed to a component and that component calls
                  the state setter which mutates the state:
                      1. the component that mutates the state will re-render 
                      2. the children of the component that cause the state change 
                        will re-render as well

                - SIMPLE state management hook = React.useState() hook 
                    - see https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-usestate-hook/
                    setSearchTerm is the setter function that modifies value of the variable "searchTerm"
                    Example:const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState('');

                    -useState can be used for javascript primitives (e.g integers, booleans, strings, and also arrays)
                    But when you plan to manage complex state with "objects" and "complex" arrays,
                    consider using "useReducer" hook

                - COMPLEX state management hook - Reducer Hook 
                    - https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-state-usereducer-usestate-usecontext/ 
                    once you plan to manage more complex state with objects or more complex arrays, 
                    you should check out React's useReducer hook.
                    See https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-state-usereducer-usestate-usecontext/

                    - scenarios where useReducer hook outshines useState. Complex:
                        1. Complex state Containers
                        2. Complex state Transitions
                        3. Conditional State Updates
              

  13. Read more about JavaScript array destructuring
            https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#array_destructuring


  14. JavaScript array's built-in filter method
            Example Using javascript function expression
              const searchedStories = stories.filter(function (story) {
                return story.title.includes(searchTerm);
            });
            
            Example returning items based on word length:
              const words = [
                  'spray',
                  'limit',
                  'elite',
                  'exuberant',
                  'destruction',
                  'present'
                ];
  
              const filteredWords = words.filter(function (word) {
                return word.length > 6;
              });


            Example using arrow function:
                //filter() is a method of an object. In this case stories. 
                //It could be made more concise by using an 
                //arrow function with an immediate return. The searchTerm could be case sensitive.
                //To make it work,  fix this problem yourself by making the filter() method's 
                //condition case insensitive. so convert everything to lower case.
                const searchedStories = stories.filter((story) =>
                  story.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())
                );

  15. Lifting State
      Question: What is lifting state in React?
        Answer: Lifting state refers to the practice of moving the state from a 
                child component to its parent component.

      Question: Why would you lift state in React?
        Answer: To share and manage state at a higher level, making it accessible 
                to multiple child components.

      Question: How do you lift state in React?
        Answer: Move the state and related functions to a common ancestor 
                (usually a parent) component.

      Question: Can multiple child components share the same lifted state?
        Answer: Yes, lifting state allows multiple child components to share 
        the same state.

      Question: What's the advantage of lifting state over using local 
                state in a component?
        Answer: Lifting state promotes sharing state among components.

      Question: What is the role of callbacks in lifting state?
        Answer: Callback functions are used to pass data from child to parent 
                components when lifting state.

      Question: Can a child component modify the state of a parent component directly through a callback handler?
        Answer: No, the child component can invoke the callback to notify the 
                parent, and the parent can decide how to update its state.

      Question: Is it necessary to lift all state to the top-level parent component?
        Answer: No, only lift state to a level where it needs to be shared 
                among multiple components.

      Question: How does lifting state contribute to better component reusability?
        Answer: Lifting state allows stateful logic to be concentrated in a common 
        ancestor, making components more reusable.

  16. Controlled Component 
      - Example:
        {/* // B - Pass in the initial state search={searchTerm}*/}
        <Search onSearch={handleSearch} search={searchTerm}/>; 

      - Question: What is a controlled component in React?
          Answer: A controlled component is a component whose form elements 
                  are controlled by React state e.g pass in an initial state.

        Question: How do you create a controlled input in React?
          Answer: Set the input value attribute to a state variable and provide 
                  an onChange handler to update the state.

      Question: What is the role of the value prop in a controlled input element?
          Answer: The value prop sets the current value of the input, making it 
          a controlled component.
          Example: <input id="search" 
                    type="text" 
                    value={props.search} 
                    onChange={props.onSearch} />

        Question: How do you handle a controlled checkbox in React?
          Answer: Use the checked attribute and provide an onChange 
                  handler to update the corresponding state.

        Question: How do you clear the value of a controlled component?
          Answer: Set the state variable to an empty or null value to clear 
                  the value of a controlled component.

      Question: What are the potential downsides of using controlled components?
          Answer: Controlled components can lead to verbose code, 
          especially in forms with many input elements.

REVIEW FOLDER2
      This folder contains code examples for: Props Handling,  

   1. Props Handling (Advanced)
      - props are just Javascript object (e.g props.list, props.onsearch...)
        which just passes info from one component to another, we can use 
        javascript "object destructuring" to access its properties.

   2. Props Destructuring via Object Destructuring
      Example: 
        const user = {
          firstName: 'Robin',
          lastName: 'Wieruch',
        };
        
        // without object destructuring
        const firstName = user.firstName;
        const lastName = user.lastName;
        
        // with object destructuring. This  is the preferred way
        const { firstName, lastName } = user;

   3. Basic Destructuring props within the function body:
        const Search = (props) => {
           const {search, onSearch} = props;

        return (
            <div>
            <label htmlFor="search">Search: </label>
              <input
                id="search"
                type="text"
                value={search}
                onChange={onSearch}
              />
            </div>
          );
         };
 
    4. Destucturing props object right away in the function signature
    and omitting the function's block body of the component:

      const Search = ({ search, onSearch }) => ( //note no return statememt
          <div> 
            <label htmlFor="search">Search: </label>
            <input
              id="search"
              type="text"
              value={search}
              onChange={onSearch}
            />
          </div>
        );

   4. Nested Destructuring
        - see comments in renderListDestructuringPropsInFunctionSignature
          and  renderListUsingRestDestructuring
        const user = {
          firstName: 'Robin',
          pet: { 
            name: 'Trixi'
          },
        };

        //without object destructuring
        const firstName  = user.firstName;
        conts name = user.pet.name;

        //with nested destructuring
        const {
            firstName,
            pet: {
               name,
            },
        } = user;

REVIEW FOLDER3 - useEffect and Side Effects 
   see C:\_AMyReactDev\robinreactcoursedev\hacker9-stories-react-side-effects-useEffects-9

   1. React output is determined by:
        - props and its state 
        - and "side effect"

   2. Making Search component remember what happened in the previous iteration.
       - first store recent search to local storage (see app.jsx)

   3. useEffect Hook
       - facilitates the inclusion of side effects in the lifcycle of a react component.

       React.useEffect(() => {
            localStorage.setItem('search', searchTerm);
         }, [searchTerm]);

       React's useEffect Hook takes two arguments: The first argument is a 
       function that runs our side-effect. In our case, the side-effect stores searchTerm 
       into the browser's local storage. The second argument is a dependency array 
       of variables. If one of these variables changes, the function for the 
       side-effect is called. 
       
       When is useEffect fires:
         1. any changes to the dependency array will fire the useEffect hook
         2. if dependency array is left out, the function in useEffect will fire on 
            every render (initial render and update renders) of the component 
         3. if the dependency array is empty array e.g [], the function is onlt called 
            once when the component renders the first time
         4. It can be triggered when the component is first mounted, but also if one of 
            its values (state, props, derived values from state/props) is updated.

          Question: What is useEffect in React?
             Answer: useEffect is a hook in React that allows function components to 
                  perform side effects.
          Question: Can you use multiple useEffect hooks in one component?
             Answer: Yes, you can use multiple useEffect hooks in a single component.

          Question: What does the second argument in useEffect represent?
             Answer: The second argument is an array of dependencies. The effect runs 
             when any of these dependencies change.

          Question: How do you run useEffect only once (on mount)?
             Answer: Pass an empty dependency array ([]) as the second argument.

          Question: Can useEffect return a cleanup function?
             Answer: Yes, the function returned from useEffect serves as a cleanup function.

          Question: What is the purpose of the cleanup function in useEffect?
             Answer: It handles the cleanup or teardown of resources when the component 
             unmounts or when the dependencies change.
             
          Question: How do you perform cleanup in useEffect for each render?
             Answer: Return a function inside the useEffect with the cleanup logic.

          Question: Can you conditionally run useEffect based on a certain condition?
             Answer: Yes, you can use conditional statements inside useEffect to control when 
             it should run.

          Question: What happens if you omit the second argument in useEffect?
              Answer: It runs the effect after every render, leading to potential performance 
              issues.

          Question: How does useEffect contribute to avoiding race conditions in React?
             Answer: It allows you to handle asynchronous operations and avoid race conditions 
             by managing the order of execution.

                 Delete record
   - Scenario 
       Implement our next feature that enables the removal of items from the list.

   - Tasks: 
       1. The application renders a list of items and allows its users to filter 
          the list via a search feature. 

          
       2. Next the application should render a button next to each list item which 
         allows its users to remove the item from the list.

       3. Incorporate bootstrap
  
   - Solution: 
       - see C:\_AMyReactDev\reviewFolder5-inline-handlers

       - Display a formatted List. 
           See: C:\_AMyReactDev\chitoreactdev\_guijt-house-react-projects\house-1-forsale-react-house-list
           1. Import the following in main.jsx
              import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
              import "bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min"

           2. Update index.css

       - The list of items needs to become a stateful value (here: stateful array) with 
         useState in order to manipulate it (e.g. removing an item) later.

       - Every list item should renders a button with a click handler. When clicking the button, 
         the item gets removed from the list by MANIPULATING the state.
         See: https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-button/

       - Since the stateful list resides in the App component, one needs to use 
         callback handlers to enable the Item component to communicate up to the 
         App component for removing an item by its identifier.

        - Setup Bootstrap
          npm install bootstrap
          Once the installation is complete, we can include it in our app’s 
          entry file in main.jsx :
          --  Bootstrap CSS
          import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
          -- Bootstrap Bundle JS
          import "bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min";

          Now since we created the project with Vite, we can rely 
          on Vite's plugins to integrate ESLint properly. Run the 
          following command
            npm install vite-plugin-eslint --save-dev

              boiler project created by Robin in https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/
              The project enables you to write JavaScript applications with Webpack and Babel.
            
              Extract the project to: C:\_AMyReactDev\reviewFolder9-how-to-test-react-components

                       - visit http://localhost:8000/

              While in  https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/ go to 
              the section labelled Table of Contents and go through the link of the following
              tutorials: 
                  
                 A. React with Babel - https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/#react-with-babel
                 B. React with Webpack - https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/#react-with-webpack
                 C. Hot Module Replacement in React - https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/#hot-module-replacement-in-react

               (A). Details of React with Babel tutorial:
                     npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-react

                    In your .babelrc (or package.json) file -- depending on where you have your 
                    Babel configuration for presets and plugins -- add the new preset. 
                    In this tutorial, we will add it in our .babelrc file. 
                    Add the "preset" code to .babelrc
                         {
                          "presets": [
                            "@babel/preset-env",
                            "@babel/preset-react"
                          ]
                        }

                     Next let's inform Webpack in our webpack.config.js file about files 
                     with the JSX extension to make sure that they run through the 
                     transpiling step as well. see notes in webpack.config.js

                     That's it for enabling React in JavaScript by using Babel and Webpack. 
                     We are allowed to write React with JSX now

                (B). Details of React with Webpack tutorial: 
                     So far you should have the following folder structure:
                          - node_modules/
                          - dist/
                            -- index.html
                          - src/
                            -- index.js
                          - package.json
                          - webpack.config.js   

                     Next In order to use React, you need two libraries (node packages):
                     react and react-dom. Install it from root folder 
                     C:\_AMyReactDev\reviewFolder9-how-to-test-react-components:
                       npm install --save react react-dom

                     Next go to src/index.js and implement your entry point which is  document.getElementById('app'):    
                         ReactDOM.render(
                          <div>{title}</div>,
                          document.getElementById('app')
                        );

                     Next the React DOM API takes two arguments. The first argument is 
                     the rendered JSX from React, the second argument is the HTML <div id="app">
                     element where it should be integrated into the DOM. 
                         Since it expects an HTML element 
                     identified by an id attribute, we need to add this element in our 
                     dist/index.html file:
                         go dist/index.html and add <div id="app"></div>

                     do Start your application with npm start to see the output.

                (C). Details of React with Hot Module Replacement tutorial: 
                     A huge development boost will give you react-hot-loader (Hot Module Replacement). 
                     It will shorten your feedback loop during development. Basically whenever you 
                     change something in your source code, the change will apply in your app running 
                     in the browser without reloading the entire page.
                     
                         First do: npm install --save-dev react-hot-loader 
                         Install it from root folder C:\_AMyReactDev\reviewFolder9-how-to-test-react-components

                     Second: Add the configuration to your webpack.config.js file:

                     Third: modify src/index.js. You have to define that hot reloading is 
                          available and should be used:
                           devServer: {
                            static: path.resolve(__dirname, './dist'),
                            hot: true,
                          },

                      If you would remove the module.hot.accept(); line in index.js, the browser would 
                      perform a reload if something has changed in the source code. 

            (2) Finally create your first component. In your src/index.js file define
              App.js component and import app.js 

                    cd src/
                    touch App.js   
                    then go to VS Code and add the code to App.js
                       import React from 'react';

                        const App = ({ title }) =>
                          <div>{title}</div>;

                        export default App;

   2. Step2: How to Test React with JEST (Configure your testing):

         Demo: c:\_AMyReactDev\reviewFolder9-testing-settingup-testing-using-Jest-and-React-Testing-Lib

         Go to Course Module --> Testing --> Select JEST Pane - https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-testing-jest/

         Go to Jest Testing in React Setup - https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-testing-jest/
 

         This tutorial is part 2 of 2 in the series.
           Part 1: How to set up React with Webpack and Babel (discussed in Step1:) - https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/

         Notes:
            JEST comes with its own test runner. All your tests are defined as:
                1. "Test Suites" (e.g. describe-block)
                2. "Test Cases" (e.g. it-block or test-block)
            The Jest setup allows you to add optional configuration, to introduce a setup 
            routine yourself, or to define custom npm scripts to run your Jest tests. 
            In this tutorial, you will learn how to perform all of it.

         Setting it Up: 
            Bring up C:\_AMyReactDev\reviewFolder9-how-to-test-react-components we created in Step 1.
            - add the following to src/index.js

            - add the following code to src/app.js and do  
                npm install axios 
                
            - in order to get our tests up and running, set up Jest by installing 
              it on the command line as development dependencies:
                          npm install --save-dev jest

                  (A) modify package.json to create a new npm script which runs jest
                      "scripts": {
                        "start": "webpack serve --config ./webpack.config.js --mode development",
                        "test": "jest --config ./jest.config.json"
                      },
                      next define this optional configuration for jest ./jest.config.json"
                      in a configuration file. From command line/ROOT of the project do:
                            touch jest.config.json
                      this file will be created in the project root  (not in ./src)   


                  (B) put the following test pattern in jest.config.json to run all test files
                    which shall be executed by Jest
                        {
                          "testRegex": "((\\.|/*.)(spec))\\.js?$"
                        }
                      //The testRegex configuration is a regular expression that can be used to specify the 
                      //naming of the files where your Jest tests will be located. In this case, the files will
                      //have the name *spec.js. That's how you can separate them clearly from other files 
                      //in your src/ folder.

                   (C) Next, add a test file next to your App component's file in a new src/App.spec.js file.
                         touch src/App.spec.js
                         
                   (D) And second, implement your first test case in a test suite in this new file:
                          describe('My Test Suite', () => {
                            it('My Test Case', () => {
                              expect(true).toEqual(true);
                            });
                          });

                    (E) And finally Now you should be able to run:
                             npm test 
                        to execute your test suites with your test cases. The test should 
                        be green (valid, successful) for your previous test case, 
                        but if you change the test to something else, 
                        let's say expect(true).toEqual(false);, it should be red (invalid, failed). 
                        Congratulations, you have run your first test with Jest!

                        Add another script in package.json: "test:watch": "npm run test -- --watch"

                        Doing this you can have two terminals: 
                          1. terminal tab to start your React application with 
                               npm start
                          2. Terminal tab for your Jest tests in watch mode with 
                               npm run test:watch 

             -  Congratulations, you have run your first test with Jest!

   3. Jest Snapshot Testing in React  (TODO)
       - Jest introduced the so-called Snapshot Test. Basically a Snapshot Test creates 
         a snapshot -- which is stored in a separate file -- of your rendered component's 
         output when you run your test.

       - By using Jest for Snapshot Tests, you can keep your tests lightweight, without worrying 
         too much about implementation details of the component. Let's see how these work in React. 

         install the react-test-renderer utility library:
            npm install --save-dev react-test-renderer

       -  add a test file next to your App component's file in a new src/App.spec.js file.

             First, create the test file on the command line:
              touch src/App.spec.js
             Second, Add another npm script in package.json for watching your Jest tests
              "test:watch": "npm run test -- --watch"
   
             Now run the test:
              npm run test:watch

              it('does the following', () => {           <-  it-block or test-case

              });
            });

       - Defining an "It-Block" (which can be named "test instead of it")

   6. Testing using Vitest React Testing Library (TODO)
        - https://www.robinwieruch.de/vitest-react-testing-library/

   7. React Testing Library: Rendering a Component

       - https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-testing-library/

       - After the setup in Jest or Vitest, you will learn how to render a 
         React component in a test with React Testing Library. We will use the 
         following function component called App component from a src/App.js file:
            


  //============================================  
  //*    Notes: React Testing Overview
  //============================================          
   - Type of Tests:
        - unit tests, integration tests, snapshot tests, 
          end-to-end tests (also called E2E tests) 

   - If you created the project using "CREATE-REACT-APP' ignore most of the setup sections
     because it it comes with Jest as test runner and assertion library. You could add various 
     other testing libraries such as Enzyme and React Testing Library to it.

     Otherwise use https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/
     (How to React with Webpack 5 - Setup Tutorial) if you are not using create-react-app

   - Testing pyramid -> unit testing --> integration testing --> E-2-E testing

   - Most of your tests should follow a test pattern especially if you are using TDD
     (Test-Driven Development ) -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development
     Test-driven development (TDD) is a way of writing code that involves writing an 
     automated unit-level test case that fails, then writing just enough code to make 
     the test pass, then refactoring both the test code and the production code, then 
     repeating with another new test case.

   - Ways to test React Components
       1. Jest + React Testing Library (https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-testing-library/)
       2. Jest + Enzyme
          As you can see, there are various ways to test React components:
          Mocha, Chai, Sinon + Enzyme: If you are coming from a Node.js environment.
          Jest + Enzyme/React Testing Library: If you want to test the more idiomatic way.

   - My preferred way:  Jest + React Testing Library

     In addition, you may want to end-to-end test your React applications as well. I have 
     found Cypress the best option to conduct these kinds of tests: How to test React 
     components E2E with Cypress https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-testing-cypress/. 
     If you want to dive into visual regression testing, you can use React Storybook: 
     Visual Regression Tests and React Storybook 
     https://www.robinwieruch.de/visual-regression-testing-react-storybook/.

   - Last but not least, to get the most out of your tests in an automated environment, 
     you may want to use continuous integration (CI) to run your tests before deploying 
     your JavaScript application:
       1. How to set up Continuous Integration for JavaScript
            https://www.robinwieruch.de/javascript-continuous-integration/

       2. How to set up JavaScript Test Coverage
             https://www.robinwieruch.de/javascript-test-coverage/
          
   - Conclusion:
       I would say that testing React components with Mocha/Chai is rather optional, 
       because JEST is the better alternative for it. Also visual regression testing may not 
       be relevant for everyone. My recommended test stack would be 

           Jest + Enzyme/React Testing Library for unit/integration tests and 
           Cypress for end-to-end tests. 

       Then add testing coverage to the mix and connect your application to your 
       favorite CI to run your tests in the cloud as well.

   - How to test React components with Jest +  React Testing Library Tutorial
        (https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-testing-library/)        
        Jest and React Testing Library need each other
   - Examples:
        describe('my function or component', () => { //decribe-block is the test suite
        it('does the following', () => {             //it-block is the test case

        });  });
    
   - Now go to Jest with React Testing Library https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-testing-jest/
     and do the following as described in the tutorial in the above link:
       (1) create the app as descibed in the link
       (2) install Jest: npm install --save-dev jest
           
   - Now run your test via Jest's  test runner: npm run test, you will see
     the following output: 
       PASS  src/App.test.js
          true is truthy and false is falsy
            ✓ true is truthy (3ms)
            ✓ false is falsy
